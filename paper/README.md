# What we did on our holidays

This paper will describe an implementation of an algorithm by Griess to construct a twisted cocycle describing the multiplication in a code loop, as well as a method to reconstruct the full cocycle from a function defined on a domain of size approximately the square root of the original. 

Additionally, we find a new basis for the extended Golay code with the property that the twisted cocycle built from it by Griess' algorithm is trivial on a pair of subspaces with trivial intersection, of dimensions 6 and 5 respectively.
