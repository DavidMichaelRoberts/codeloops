# codeloops

## About

`codeloops` is initial maths research code to implement code loops as extensions of doubly even binary codes.  Initial goal is to build the loop over the Hamming[8,4] code and then Parker loop over the Golay code. This is undergraduate code with no practical relevance for anyone except me.
